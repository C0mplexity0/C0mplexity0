Hi, I'm C0mplexity

I primarily focus on web development, but also enjoy branching my knowledge with other languages or projects

Here is some of my work:
- Pixel Wars https://github.com/C0mplexity0/PIXEL-WARS
    - A small online multiplayer game made using canvases
    - Also one of the first websites I made using node.js, which explains the messy code
