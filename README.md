Hi, I'm Adam,

I focus on a lot of web development, or other projects using web technologies, but I also like to branch out and experiment with other forms of software, such as game development and utilities.

Here is some of my work:
- Tiny Games https://github.com/C0mplexity0/tiny-games
    - An Electron app which allows people to play games on a computer, and connect other devices to use as controllers to allow for console-like multiplayer without the need for a console or any controllers.
    - Makes use of this boilerplate: https://github.com/C0mplexity0/electron-forge-react-vite-boilerplate

- PIXEL WARS https://github.com/C0mplexity0/PIXEL-WARS
    - A small online multiplayer game made using Socket.IO.
    - Also the first large project I've worked on in software, largely left as an archive now.

 These are my main two major projects which are available on GitHub as of now, I may add more over time as I open source existing projects and work on new ones.
